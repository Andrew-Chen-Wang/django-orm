# Django Standalone ORM Cookiecutter

A cookiecutter template to getting started on a Python
project that utilizes the Django ORM. This is just
a more advanced version of the django-orm-template
which I use for quickly getting started on something.

This cookiecutter includes configurations whereas the
quick setup just gives you everything as a template repository.

### Why?

I really love the Django ORM. After working with SQLAlchemy,
I understood the verbose beauty, simplicity, and speed of development
of Django's ORM.

Additionally, I needed a way to quickly upgrade the ORM and be unit tested.
This is also in preparation for an async ORM. So this is more like a fork
that also includes unit tests and configurations that I require.
